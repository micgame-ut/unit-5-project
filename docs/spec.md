# Specification

> EDITING DIRECTIVE: DEVELOPER AND AGENT EDIT THIS FILE COLLABORATIVELY. THE DEVELOPER MUST REVIEW AND APPROVE ITS CONTENT.

Purpose: Keep a concise, testable description of what the project should do now and how the system is structured to do it.

## Working agreement

Developer: Approve the intended behavior and the system's structure, test directly, understand each part well enough to explain it in your own words, and update this file whenever either changes.

Agent: Read the project documents and inspect the project. Turn the Developer's decisions into acceptance checks without inventing product choices or freezing details that still need testing. Propose structures suited to the project's scope, with their trade-offs, in plain language. Keep the architecture consistent with the actual project and point out where they have drifted apart. Do not restructure the project without the Developer's approval.

When you begin this step, start a fresh chat so its transcript stays clean. For example:

`Read the project documents, inspect the project, and help me specify what the next version should do.`

## Intended experience

What Users should be able to do and experience in the current version, tied to the goals in your pitch.

## Behavior and acceptance checks

For each feature or behavior you are building, describe what it should do and what counts as working, including failure cases and accessibility where they apply. Distinguish approved behavior from provisional ideas, and leave untested details open until they are needed.

## Architecture

How the system works and the structural decisions that keep it coherent, consistent, and easy to change. Adapt these sections to your project and tech stack.

### Overview

The main parts of the system, what each is responsible for, and how they connect. Include a simple diagram.

### Data and state

What information the system keeps, where each piece lives, and how it moves and changes. Name the single source of truth for each important piece of state.

### Interaction loop

How User input or other events lead to changes in state and then to what the User sees, hears, or receives.

### Visual and content rules

The shared rules that establish the art style and keep the presentation consistent, such as branding, layout, color, type, motion, sound, and asset conventions.

### Structure rules

The conventions that keep the system lean: how files and code are organized, where new features belong, and the general rules that handle cases by design instead of one-off fixes.

### Decisions and changes

Consequential structural decisions, the alternatives considered, and why you chose as you did, including later changes to the structure.

| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-26 | URP, Windows, 60 FPS target (provisional with the Unity choice) | Project baseline |
| 2026-10-26 | Hybrid folders (Core + Features) with assembly definitions | Navigable at scale; faster compiles |
| 2026-10-26 | Mechanics ship functional first; juice added later through events | Test feel bare; avoid rework; reusable juice tools |
| 2026-10-26 | Particle/trail settings via runtime config scripts | Hide inspector bloat; expose only what matters |
| 2026-10-26 | Test captures are temporary, outside `Assets/`, deleted after review | No image bloat in project or repo |
| 2026-10-26 | Milestone snapshots (3–5 images) kept in `Docs/Milestones/` | Lightweight visual history for documentation |
| 2026-10-26 | No Git LFS | GitHub Download ZIP (weekly snapshot) leaves LFS files as pointers |
